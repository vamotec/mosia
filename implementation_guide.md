## Risk Management Playbooks

### Critical Path Blocker Response
```
BLOCKER SEVERITY: CRITICAL (blocks >2 people)
RESPONSE TIME: <4 hours

ESCALATION CHAIN:
1. Blocker reported in #blockers channel
2. Blocker owner assigned within 30 minutes
3. If no resolution plan within 2 hours → Escalate to tech lead
4. If no resolution within 4 hours → All-hands problem solving
5. If no resolution within 8 hours → Activate contingency plan

CONTINGENCY STRATEGIES:
Infrastructure Issues:
- Fallback to local development environments
- Use staging environment for critical development
- Implement partial solutions to unblock dependent work

Database Schema Issues:  
- Use database versioning to support parallel development
- Create migration scripts for gradual rollout
- Implement feature flags for schema-dependent features

Authentication/Security Issues:
- Implement OAuth2 provider integration (Auth0/Firebase)
- Use JWT tokens with simple validation for development
- Defer complex security features to later iterations
```

### Integration Failure Recovery
```
INTEGRATION FAILURE RESPONSE:
Within 30 minutes:
□ Identify root cause (communication, technical, or process)
□ Assess impact on other teams and critical path
□ Implement immediate workaround if possible
□ Communicate status to affected teams

Within 2 hours:
□ Develop comprehensive fix plan
□ Identify additional testing needed  
□ Update integration timeline if needed
□ Schedule resolution validation meeting

Within 24 hours:
□ Implement permanent fix
□ Validate fix with all affected teams
□ Update integration procedures to prevent recurrence
□ Conduct brief retrospective on lessons learned
```

## Performance Optimization Strategies

### Parallel Execution Maximization

**Week 1-4: Foundation Parallelization**
```
OPTIMIZATION OPPORTUNITIES:
While DevOps sets up infrastructure:
- Backend Dev: Architecture documentation and schema design
- AI Engineer: Model research and evaluation (no infrastructure needed)
- Frontend Dev: Design system and component planning  
- QA Engineer: Test strategy and framework selection

COORDINATION POINTS:
- Day 3: Architecture review affects all subsequent work
- Day 7: Infrastructure availability enables environment-specific work
- Day 10: Schema design affects backend and AI work
- Day 14: All foundations ready for next phase
```

**Week 5-8: Service Development Parallelization**
```
OPTIMIZATION OPPORTUNITIES:  
While Backend Dev builds authentication:
- Frontend Dev: Build authentication UI with mock APIs
- AI Engineer: Train models using sample data
- DevOps: Optimize database performance  
- QA Engineer: Build automated test suites

COORDINATION POINTS:
- Day 21: Auth API specification available for frontend mocks
- Day 28: Real auth API ready for frontend integration
- Day 35: AI models ready for backend integration
- Day 42: All core services integrated and tested
```

### Resource Conflict Resolution

**High-Conflict Periods Management**
```
WEEK 9-10: Backend Dev Overload (Conversation System + API Support)
SOLUTION:
- QA Engineer takes over API documentation  
- Frontend Dev uses comprehensive mock APIs
- AI Engineer handles more of the data pipeline work
- DevOps provides database optimization support

WEEK 11-12: AI Engineer Split Focus (Portfolio Analysis + Conv. Optimization)
SOLUTION:  
- Backend Dev assists with data preprocessing
- Conversation optimization moves to performance tuning phase
- Portfolio Analysis gets 80% of AI Engineer time
- Cross-training enables Backend Dev to help with simpler AI tasks

WEEK 13-14: Integration Pressure (All Roles Needed)
SOLUTION:
- Staged integration approach (one system at a time)
- Extended daily standups for coordination
- Dedicated integration environment to prevent conflicts  
- Weekend integration sessions if needed
```
