## 3. Dependency Resolution Strategies

### Handoff Protocols

**üîÑ API Contract First**
```
Backend Dev ‚Üí Frontend Dev
1. API specification (OpenAPI/Swagger) delivered 48h before implementation
2. Mock endpoints available for frontend development
3. Real API integration in final week of sprint
4. Automated contract testing validates compatibility
```

**ü§ñ AI Model Integration**
```
AI Engineer ‚Üí Backend Dev
1. Model interface specification (inputs/outputs/performance)
2. Containerized model with health checks
3. Fallback mechanisms for model failures
4. Performance benchmarks and SLA definitions
```

**üóÑÔ∏è Database Schema Changes**
```
Backend Dev ‚Üí All Teams
1. Schema migration scripts with rollback procedures
2. 48h notice for breaking changes
3. Database seeding scripts for testing
4. Performance impact assessment
```

### Coordination Checkpoints

**üìÖ Weekly Sync Pattern**
- **Monday**: Dependency check-in and blocker identification
- **Wednesday**: Integration testing and handoff validation
- **Friday**: Sprint planning and next-week dependency mapping

**üéØ Phase Gate Reviews**
```
End of Week 4:  Foundation Complete
- Infrastructure operational
- Core schemas deployed
- Development environments ready
- Team velocity established

End of Week 8:  Core Services Ready
- Authentication working
- AI foundation operational
- Basic APIs available
- Frontend framework established

End of Week 12: Features Functional
- All P0 features implemented
- Integration testing passing
- Performance benchmarks met
- User testing initiated

End of Week 16: Production Ready
- Full system integration
- Security testing complete
- Performance optimized
- Documentation delivered
```

### Fallback Plans

**üö® Critical Dependency Failures**
```
IF Infrastructure Setup Delayed (Week 1-2):
‚Üí THEN: Use local Docker environments, parallel development
‚Üí IMPACT: 0-1 week delay
‚Üí RECOVERY: Weekend infrastructure sprint

IF AI Model Training Fails (Week 5-6):
‚Üí THEN: Use pre-trained models (GPT-4, Claude API)
‚Üí IMPACT: Reduced customization, higher API costs
‚Üí RECOVERY: Continue with custom training in parallel

IF Database Schema Major Changes (Week 3-4):
‚Üí THEN: Use database versioning and gradual migration
‚Üí IMPACT: 1-2 week delay for dependent services
‚Üí RECOVERY: Parallel development on separate schema versions

IF Authentication Security Issues (Week 4-6):
‚Üí THEN: Use OAuth2 provider (Auth0, Firebase Auth)
‚Üí IMPACT: External dependency, ongoing costs
‚Üí RECOVERY: Custom auth development continues in parallel
```
